<div class='pTitle'>Childhood Health and Lifecycle Human Capital Formation</div>
<div style="width:100%">
A growing body of literature emphasizes the role of childhood health in shaping
labor market outcomes. Little is yet known whether poor health during
childhood influences later outcomes by restricting skill formation, or by mainly
affecting future health. To address this issue, this paper formulates and estimates
a model of the joint dynamics of skills and health over the lifecycle.
The estimated model is used to quantify the relative importance of the channels
through which childhood health conditions affect labor market outcomes. In the
model, individuals are endowed with a multi-dimensional human capital bundle
that consists of skills and health. The human capital bundle evolves over time
according to a production technology, with influences from endogenous decisions
regarding schooling, labor supply, and occupations. The results indicate that
the most important channel accounting for mental health-related earnings gaps
is the skill channel. About 60-65% of the earnings gaps can be explained by the
effects of childhood mental health conditions on skill formation. The effects of
childhood health status on health formation are also found to play important
roles.

<div class='pTitle'>The Long Reach of Childhood Health on Skills: Task-based Evidence</div>
<div style="width:100%">
 Existing evidence indicates that certain health conditions during childhood affect schooling
outcomes. However, little is known as to whether and how such influences persist into
adult skills beyond academic skills. By adopting a multidimensional skills/tasks approach,
this paper documents the link between childhood health conditions and skills used in the
labor market. To obtain objective measures of childhood health status, this paper exploits
the structure of sequential medical examinations conducted in the 1958 National Child Development
Study. The results point to the importance of childhood health conditions in
generating occupational sorting in the labor market. In particular, I find that those who had
mental disorders before age 16 tend to select into less cognitive skill demanding occupations
while those who had physical disorders sort into less manual skill demanding occupations.
The observed variation in occupation choices is found to be an important predictor of health-related
earnings gaps.

<div class='pTitle'>Specificity of Health Capital</div>
<div style="width:100%">
 How general is health capital? Estimates of health-related earnings losses commonly assume
that skills are predetermined and that health attributes are uniformly priced across
occupations. This paper departs from this convention and estimates the relationship between
general health status and wages, and how the relationship depends on worker skills
and the nature of tasks performed by the workers. Using the National Longitudinal Study
of Older Men (NLSM), this paper first documents that poor health status is concentrated
among workers in manual skill demanding occupations. This indicates that health status
among older workers is strongly associated with their manual skills. This paper further
shows that the wage effects of poor health status vary depending on the intensity of manual
tasks conducted on the job. The empirical results highlight the importance of accounting for
the differences in skills and tasks to better understand the health-related wage differentials.
